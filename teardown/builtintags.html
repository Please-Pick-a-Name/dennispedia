<main id="docs-main">
	<h1>Built-in Tags</h1>
	<p>The registry (not to be confused with the Windows registry) consists of what the official modding documentation refers to as "nodes", which are key and value pairs where both are strings.</p>
	<p>Registry nodes are not to be confused with <a href="teardown/g/Command.html">commands</a>, which follow the same naming conventions but are handled entirely separately.</p>
	<h2>Tags</h2>
	<p>"Non-engine" means it is only ever get or set by Lua scripts, and never by the engine.</p>
