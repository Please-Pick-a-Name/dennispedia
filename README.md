## Contributing
- No personal information.
- No warez. No supporting piracy. No redistribution of game content.
	- No step-by-step guides for enabling premium without paying. Describing how premium checks work is okay.
	- Documenting anti-tamper is okay. Step-by-step guides for defeating official anti-tamper are okay, but external protections such as Steam DRM are out of scope.
	- Distributing decryption keys is okay, **except for Teardown.**
	- Of all of the rules, this one is the most negotiable.
- No frameworks or libraries. No Bootstrap. No jQuery.
- No mandatory JavaScript. Non-essential JavaScript is okay.
- No external resources. No embeds. Links are okay.
- Follow the same "code" style as the existing content.
	- Ensure content is accessible to users who are colorblind, use a screen reader, or otherwise have unconventional needs.
